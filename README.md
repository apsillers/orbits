Orbits is an amusing gravirty physics simulation -- not (yet) quite enough to be called a "game", but pretty fun nevertheless.

Play consists of emitters launching a stream of pellets into the arena, which are redirected (and sometimes consumed) by gravity wells. The arena is filled with different "color targets" which alter the properties of any pellet that passes through them: they may alter the pellet's speed, affect its susceptibility to gravity, or give th eshot its own gravitational field.

Orbits encourages experimentation by allowing you to fully customize the arena with new emitters, targets, and gavity wells.  If you create a level that you partiularly enjoy, fell free to save it and share it with your friends.
