*Orbits* is a gravirty physics simulation toy written in HTML5.

Play consists of **emitters** launching a stream of **pellets** into the arena, which can be redirected (and consumed) by **gravity wells**. The arena is filled with different **repaint targets** which alter the properties of any pellet that passes through them: they can alter the pellet's speed, affect its susceptibility to gravity, or give the shot its own gravitational field.

*Orbits* encourages experimentation by allowing you to fully customize the arena with new emitters, targets, and gavity wells.  If you create a level that you partiularly enjoy, feel free to save it and share it with your friends.
