Orbits is a gravity-based physics simulation toy written in HTML5.  To play with it, visit the [**Github-hosted demo**](http://apsillers.github.com/orbits/index.html) and get to tinkering!

Play consists of **emitters** launching a stream of **pellets** into the arena, which can be redirected (and consumed) by **gravity wells**. The arena is filled with different **repaint targets** which alter the properties of any pellet that passes through them: they can alter the pellet's speed, affect its susceptibility to gravity, or give the shot its own gravitational field. There are also draggable blocks, which serve as barriers for the pellets.

Orbits encourages experimentation by allowing you to fully customize the arena with new blocks, emitters, targets, and gavity wells.  If you create a level that you partiularly enjoy, feel free to save it and share it with your friends.

**TODO:**

- Features:
 - Add full-screen support
 - Prettify the menu
 - Add emitter options (speed, fire rate)
 - Allow editing of global constants
 - Allow rotation of blocks

- Bugs:
 - Fix buggy drag support in Cake v2.0rc1
 - Fix new-well-drag draw behavior
 - Fix drag-over-shots behavior of blocks
